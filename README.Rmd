# Robson10Classifier

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Robson10Classifier is to provide a suite of functions to simplify classification and analysis of childbirth data according to the [Robson 10 Group Classification System](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/robson-classification/en/), which was adopted by the World Health Organisation in 2015.  

## Overview of the Robson 10 Group Classification System

The image below is a summary of the TGCS, taken from the World Health Organisation's TGCS Implementation Manual, available from [this page](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/robson-classification/en/).

## Installation

The package is not yet on CRAN.  You can install from github using the {remotes} package:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/ThomUK/Robson10Classifier", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Package Planning

The package is in the early stages of planning and development.  There follow notes on planned functionality.  

* tgcs_classify() will take values for the 6 obstetric variables, and return the Robson classification, or "unclassifiable" if some data required to do the classification is missing. If the case is classifiable but there is missing data within the obstetric variables, this will also be reported.  

* tgcs_report_unclassifiable() will take a population of birth records with obstetric variables, and will summarise the reasons for any unclassifiable records, according to which obstetric variables are missing.  

* tgcs_report_time_series() will take a population of birth records with dates (eg. births in a given healthcare facility or region), and will create an RMarkdown report of time-series trends for each Robson group, and unclassifiable records.

* tgcs_report_table() will take a population of birth records with dates, and will create a Robson Classification Report Table to the same standard as table 5 of the World Health Organisation Robson Classification Implementation Manual p.34
